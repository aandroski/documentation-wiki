    # How to Bulkload loans

   The bulkloading tool basically creates loan “shells” in Arctos.  You will fill in the basic parts of each loan in a spreadsheet, then upload it to Arctos. Next, you will populate the loan with specimen data and anything else that is missing from the “shell.” This is a useful way to save time if, for instance, you are migrating paper copies of historic (legacy) loans to Arctos for the first time. 

    #1. Filling out the Bulk Upload Template:

    ##a. Log into Arctos. Go to **Enter Data > Batch Tools > Bulkload Loans**. Click on “get CSV template,” then open the file that downloads. *You should upload no more than 15-20 loans at a time*.

    ##b. Formatting is very important, so make sure you are typing things into the spreadsheet exactly as they appear when you pull up a loan in Arctos. When entering agent names, the easiest way to make sure that 1) the agent exists in Arctos and 2) you have the name spelled and formatted correctly, is to search in Arctos DB for the agent and, if existing, copy/paste that name from Arctos into the spreadsheet. Make sure there are no leading or trailing spaces in each cell, and refer to an existing Arctos loan to check formatting and vocabulary. 
    
    ##c. Excel tends to auto-correct dates into a default format.  Change the date columns from date or number format to text format, or select the date format used in Arctos (yyyy-mm-dd).
    
    ##d.	Leave the Nature of Material, Description, and Instructions fields blank. In the Remarks field, enter “Pre-Arctos loan.”
    
    #2. Uploading the spreadsheet to Arctos:
    
    ##a. Once the columns are filled, return to Arctos. Go to **Enter data > Batch tools > Bulkload loans > Browse for csv file > upload this file**.
    
    #3.	Adding the rest of the information: 
    
    ##a. Go to Manage Data > Transactions > Find Loan. 
    
    ##b. Enter the VZ loan number in the search field. 
    
    ##c.	Select **[Edit Loan]**. 
    
    ##d.	Check through the information that has been filled in with the bulk upload (Collection, Loan Number, Agents and Roles, Loan Type, and Dates). You’ll need to change the Nature of Material, Description, and Instructions fields to reflect what’s on the original loan documentation.
    
    #4.	Adding Specimens to the Loan: 
    
    After you are finished adding information to the loan, click the light orange Save Edits button at the bottom of the Edit Loan box, then click the [add items] link below that button.
    
    ##a.	Search for specimens as you normally would. When Arctos finds your searched specimens, there will be an option next to each specimen’s parts that will allow you to add it to the loan. Select the relevant specimens/parts.
   
   ###Check the “Subsample?” box to indicate that you are taking a subsample of the specimen part (i.e. you are loaning a femur from a complete skeleton or hair from a study skin). 
    
    ##b.	If the loan is returnable and has been closed, use the drop-down menus to change the disposition of the specimens from “**on loan**” to “**in collection**.” 
    
    ##c.	If there are remarks about the condition of each specimen, you can also add these to the “**condition**” field on this page. 
    
    ##d.	Click **Back to Loan** at the top of the page (above the line that indicates the number of specimens that were found).
